--Structures
what?
Define a new type that is a collection of related data members that can be of any type
why?
Enables organizing complex data often of different types into a unit

don't forget semicolon at end of struct declaration!!!;

struct Date {
	int month;
	int mDay;
	int year;
};

Takes 12 bytes of data, 4 bytes for each int
start of Date object is address "int month"

"convention" that user define types are capitalize ("Date" not "date", granted things are different form 1999 Skretz!)

struct Date today;
today.month = 9;
today.mDay = 19;
today.year = 2016;

"." dot operator does member access

could of initialized list with:
today = {9,19,2016};

void printDate(struct Date date) {
	printf("%i/%i/%i", date.month, date.mDay, date.year);
}

Pass-by-value so date struct is copied
If struct is huge, cost could be DEADLY, you could DIE, don't do it damnit

--Typedef
what?
Define a new type name for the global name space
why?
Can make code less cluttered

Changes to use typedef approach:

typedef struct Date {
	int month;
	int mDay;
	int year;
} Date;

Date today;
today.month = 9;
today.mDay = 19;
today.year = 2016;

void printDate(Date date) {}

Use typedef in limited way, can really make code messy, so use drink and typedef responsibilities

--Pointers to Struct
why?
dynamic allocation
Avoid copying overhead with pass-by-value of structs
Allow functions to change struct params
Enable creating linked structures such as linked lists and trees
how?
delcare a pointer to a pokemon
	Pokemon  * pmPtr;
Allocate space
	pmPtr = malloc(sizeof(Pokemon));
Assigned values
	(*pmPtr).name = "Abra"; ---- THIS IS FUCKEN WRONG LOSERS
	(*pmPtr).weight = 43.0;

	strcpy((*pmPtr).name, "Abra");
	strcpy((*pmPtr).type, "Psychic");

	(*ptr).tag === ptr->tag [PREFERRED WAY]

	pmPtr->caught.month = 11;
	pmPtr->caught.mDay = 22;
	pmPtr->caught.year = 2016;

	free(pmPtr); //DONT FORGET MOTHERFUCKER

-STRINGS
what?
Are a sequence of chars whose end is marked with a null char "\0"
Represented using an array of chars which needs to be the strings length +1 for 0
how?
char str[11] = "cs 354";
	copies these characters into the memory of str

char *sptr1 - "cs 354";

str1 = "foldeno" //compiler error incompatibles types
strcpy(str1, "formication"); //too big, off by 1, no space for null character
							 //Will compiles, runs, but is a buffer overflow due to "\0"
sptr1 = "mumpsimus"; //compiles, runs, no probz
strcpy(sptr1, "vomitory"); //compiles, runs
						   //worries: memory leak, bad address in ptr, buffer overflow, non-writeable memory segments

string.h library
what?
A collection of functions to manipulate strings
strcat // make sure destination has enough space for adding src characters
