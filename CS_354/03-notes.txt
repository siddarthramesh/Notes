Pointer Basics

- what
A Pointer is a variable that stores a memory address typically of another variables
- why
Indirect access to same memory from different parts of code
Access machine hardware that is memory mapped
They are used in C libraries and OS code

int *ptr;
int *ptr, ptr2; //only p1 is an int*

DANGER: uninitialized - whatever it pattern was in its memory

printf("%p\n", ptr);
printf("%i\n", *ptr);

& is "Address of" operator
* means "is a pointer" in a declaration means access pointee elsewhere dereference

segmentation fault (core dumped)
*DONT DEREFERENCE NULL POINTERS
*DONT DEREFERENCE UNINITIALIZED POINTERS

-1D array and pointers
--what
an array is a continuous, fixed-size block of memory that is accessed through a singe name and has parts called elements that can be individually accessed
--why
Store collections of data of the same type with fast access to individual members (much easier than declaring individual vars for the collection)

Note: array name is the address of first element

*a = 0; //sets first element in array 		 	
*(a + 2) = 0; //sets 3rd element in array

TODO try *a+2


- 2D Arrays and Points to Points

int m[2][4] = {{0,1,2,3},{4,5,6,7}};
 for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
 for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++)
 printf("%i", m[i][j]);
 printf("\n");
 }

 --- Monday last page answers ----
 Ints have 4 bytes

 Memory is viewed as a sequence of bytes
 static arrays are contiguous blocks of memory

A) Yes * cancels &
B) Yes Substring[j]
C) Yes substring[i]
D) Yes substring Both


-1D Arrays of the Heap

What
Heap memory is a segment of memory used for dynamic allocation
Blocks of Heap can be allocated and freed in any arbitrary order


Why
enables a program to access more memory during execution then what was allocated by the compiler

How
malloc(size_in_bytes)
Memory ALLOCation
function in stdlib.h
reserves block of heap memory of the specified number of bytes and returns a generic pointers to that block (void *)

sizeof(operand)
Operator that returns the size in bytes for its operand
sizeof(double) (8 bytes)
sizeof(char) (1 byte)
sizeof(int) (4 byte)

int *a = malloc(sizeof(int) * 5);

*a = 0;
a[i] = 11;
*(a+2) = 22;


-Call Stack Tracing
Manually executing code (with functions) in a manner that mimics the machine
Each function call gets a box (activation records/in which is stored local variables stack ) ( including parameters)

-- Argument
AKA Actual parameters value info to be shared that's listed in the function call

-- Parameter
AKA formal parameter var location where the function stores the arguments parameter variable are declared in function header

-Pass/Call-by-value
Argument is copied into its parameter changing the parameter doesn't change its argument, used for sharing basic types

-Pass/Call-by-reference
sort of like passing references in java but it requires more syntax
Address of argument is copied into its parameter which is a pointer changing the parameters pointee does change its argument
used for sharing complex types like arrays
used to allow multiple arguments to be changed by a function

-What
Information entered at the command prompt
```gcc -Wall -Werror -m32 -std=gnu99 myProg.c```

-why
Enables a program to receive arguments and options/flags

Argc
arg: count of whitespace separated CLAs
argv: ARG values in an array of char ptrs where each points to c style string

DONT LEAVE PHONE ON BENCH !!!!

stdin, stdout, stderr
Predefined file pointers
print("test") === fprint(stdout, "test");

FILE *fopen();
If NULL is returned meas don't have access

Exit 0 == success
Exit 1 or any non zero == not successful

Programs exe read from the ".exe" by "exec"
	1. Program Code [text]
	2. Initialized Data [data]
Initialized to zero by "exec"
	3. Uninitialized Data [bss (block started by symbol)]

	4. Heap
	5. Stack
Memory Mapped Segment (space between Heap and Stack)
	Used in Linux for dynamic libraries, file i/o, large heap allocations


1. Text Segment
Typically read only
Typically sharable
2. Initialized Data Segment
	Read-Only area contains: constants and literals
	Read-Write area contains: globals, extern, and static variables
3. Uninitialized Data Segment
	Contains: globals, externs, and static variables
4. Heap
	Lifetime: Programmer managed from malloc/calloc/realloc to free
	Contains: Dynamic memory allocations
5. Stack
	Lifetime: from declaration to end of its scope
	Contains: Stack frames with non-static local variables (others - later)
	Last In First Out: When a function is called a new stack frame is added to "top" of stack, and it is removed when function returns
	Stack Frame: Set of values that are pushed onto the stack for one function call


Stack's top ("bottom of the stack")
-Command line arguments
-Environmental Variables

Arrays, structs, pointers can "live" in any of the data segments
Pointers can store any address including those in the kernel space

--Heap Terms--
Dynamic Memory:
Memory allocated during run time to satisfy run-time memory needs
Why not just static it before?
	Wastes memory - likely too much than typically needed
	Also it could still be too little

Heap:
A collection of various sized memory blocks that are either allocated or free

Block:
A contiguous chunk of virtual memory

Allocator:
code used to manage blocks of heap memory

Payload: Part of a block that is used by the program requesting the heap memory


Approaches
Implicit:
	Java: new/garbage collector
		  dont need to specify size needed or to free when done
Explicit:
	C: malloc/free
	C++: new/delete


--brk (unistd.h)--
unistd.h
header file to access POSIX API
(Portable OS Interface) <--- POSIX #IEEE

DIY Heap via Unix Calls
-brk
"program break" pointer to top of heap where heap and unused space is divided
End of the program's Data segment
	'Data Segment' is the Heap, Initialized Data, and Uninitialized Data

int brk(void *addr)
function that sets the program's data space at the given address
returns 0 if success, 1 if a failure... like Brady
clears the memory by setting all bytes to 0

void *sbrk(intptr_t incr)
changes the program break by the specified increments in bytes
returns old brk on success
-1 as type void* on failture (0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF)

*These functions are used by malloc internally (typical)
*Use malloc in your own programs since its more portable
