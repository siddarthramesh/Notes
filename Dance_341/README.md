## Week 1

> Sound Design 

1. Film (and the related time arts)
	* 1970 - credit as sound design
	* FX (Foley) - sound design = evoxative and imabinative
		* used technology to create "music" to move the listener emotionally
2. Highly techincal
	* The computer people of the music tech industry
3. Live theatre
	* sound - FX, music, etc

### `Sound` - "Musical Language" 
* Octave, Scale, etc
* Early 20th century breakdown of musical language
	* created `atonal`
* 1910
	* Complex. abstract musical language
	* not realted to the current pop, related to the art of the time
		* need to listen to it as `organized sound`
	* By playing music as "sound" and not as a strict "language"
		
### Varese Ionisation
* 1930
* realized percussion would allow for purly sound
	
### `Musiuqe Concrete`
* Music from `found` sound
* Evenutally go to tape
* 1948
* Pierre Schaeffer
	* More of french techy
		
### Phyiscal ==> Scienctific (acoustic and electronic)
1. Pitch (scales) ==> frequency
	* 12 pitches
	* 440Hz = A
	* Octave realtionship is *2
		* 110Hz -> 220Hz -> 440Hz -> 880Hz (ranges of A octaves)
	* Human range around 20Hz -- 20KHz
2. Volume (load-soft) ==> amplitude (decibel)
	* 0 DB == sound pressure level (SPL) == Ultra-quite, close to nothing
	* 120+ DB - painful
	* 85+ DB for 8 hours can do real damage to ears
3. Timbre (tone color) ==> Harmonics
	* 0 is a fundamental pitch
		* addition and substraction of harmmoics create tone color
	* Harmonic Spectrum
4. Duration (Rythm)
