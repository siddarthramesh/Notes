## Week 1

> Sound Design 

1. Film (and the related time arts)
	* 1970 - credit as sound design
	* FX (Foley) - sound design = evoxative and imabinative
		* used technology to create "music" to move the listener emotionally
2. Highly techincal
	* The computer people of the music tech industry
3. Live theatre
	* sound - FX, music, etc

### `Sound` - "Musical Language" 
* Octave, Scale, etc
* Early 20th century breakdown of musical language
	* created `atonal`
* 1910
	* Complex. abstract musical language
	* not realted to the current pop, related to the art of the time
		* need to listen to it as `organized sound`
	* By playing music as "sound" and not as a strict "language"
		
### Varese Ionisation
* 1930
* realized percussion would allow for purly sound
	
### `Musiuqe Concrete`
* Music from `found` sound
* Evenutally go to tape
* 1948
* Pierre Schaeffer
	* More of french techy
		
### Phyiscal ==> Scienctific (acoustic and electronic)
1. Pitch (scales) ==> frequency
	* 12 pitches
	* 440Hz = A
	* Octave realtionship is *2
		* 110Hz -> 220Hz -> 440Hz -> 880Hz (ranges of A octaves)
	* Human range around 20Hz -- 20KHz
2. Volume (load-soft) ==> amplitude (decibel)
	* 0 DB == sound pressure level (SPL) == Ultra-quite, close to nothing
	* 120+ DB - painful
	* 85+ DB for 8 hours can do real damage to ears
3. Timbre (tone color) ==> Harmonics
	* 0 is a fundamental pitch
		* addition and substraction of harmmoics create tone color
	* Harmonic Spectrum
4. Duration (Rythm)

## Week 2

* 1900
	* atonal (1911 onward)
	* 12-tone
	* Varese - Percussions (1930)
* 1948
	* Musiuqe Concrete
		* done without tape
		* tape in effect in 1950
		* technology == creative explosion of new sound
* Stockhausen (1956)
	* French musician
	* combined `found found` 
	* took idea from German about using electronic
	* Took human voices and altered it and started a new form of music
* Loudness
	* Attack -> Decay -> Sustain -> Release
	* known as the volume `envelope`
	
## Week 3

* Analog audio
	* `voltage` as an anlogy for `sound`
* Digital audio
	* `binary` as an anlogy for `sound`
* Microphones
	* transducers
		* takes one form as energy and tranfers it to another
	* Microphone takes sound pressure and turns into voltage
	* Types 
		* Shure SM57
			* Dynamic principle
			* Moving coil
			* **+** Can be amplified
			* **+** Tape it
			* **+** Cheap 
			* **+** Rugged
			* **-** No target for high frequency
			* **-** Not great transient response
				* Real quick change of volume
		* Condenser
			* **-** Pricey
			* **-** fragile
			* usually in studio
			* 2 magnetic plates
			* **+** great high frequency
			* **+** great transient response
			* **-** Need phantom power (48V)
				* Need batteries if portable
	* Pickup pattern (page 87)
		* Cardioid
			* Uni-directional
			* Single direction
		* Omni
			* omni-directional
			* 360 range
* Cable connectors
	* 1/4 inch
		* guitar plug
	* XLR
	* 3.5 mm
		* 1/8 inch
	* RCA
		* phono
* Block Diagram
	* layout of mixers and wires of a setup
* DAW
	* Can take mic input througha ADC
	* Once digital and on RAM can edit the datas
	* Uses a DAC to get to speakers
